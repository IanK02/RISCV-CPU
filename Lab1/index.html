Lab 1: Due Jan 19th, debugging infrastructure for RISC-V rv32i
</title>
<body>

<h3>Overview</h3>
In this lab you are to build infrastructure to help you decode and debug a RISC-V rv32i processor that you are
building in this class.  The point of this lab is just to print, in human readable form, instructions.  For example,

<pre>
   10078: ff010113              addi    sp,sp,-16
   1007c: 00112623              sw      ra,12(sp)
   10080: 00812423              sw      s0,8(sp)
   10084: 01010413              addi    s0,sp,16
   10088: 000207b7              lui     a5,0x20
   1008c: 00078513              mv      a0,a5
   10090: 360000ef              jal     ra,103f0 
   10094: 00000793              li      a5,0
   10098: 00078513              mv      a0,a5
   1009c: 00c12083              lw      ra,12(sp)
   100a0: 00812403              lw      s0,8(sp)
   100a4: 01010113              addi    sp,sp,16
   100a8: 00008067              ret
</pre>

This printout represents the PC (e.g. 0x10078), the instruction bytes (e.g. 0xff010113) and what this means
in human readable form (e.g. "addi sp,sp,-16").  Ultimately what you are building is a verilog function:

<pre>
function void print_instruction(logic [31:0] pc, logic [31:0] instruction);
	$write("%x: ", pc);
	$write("%x   ", instruction);
	// More here that you do

	$write("\n");
endfunction
</pre>

To test your function a top.sv and a hex file of instruction is included, along with a Makefile to compile
things with verilator and with iverilog (by default).  Your code must work for verilator and to ensure it does so type:

<pre>
make clean
make result-verilator
</pre>

However, verilator can be slow in the VM so developing with iverilog is often preferred (and hence, why it is the default).  To do so just type:

<pre>
make clean
make result-iverilog
</pre>

Note that ensuring your verilog code works correctly in both verilator and iverilog is the best way to work.

You are encouraged to build your own hex files and test your decoder extensively.  You can decode instructions by
using objdump to verify your results.  For example:

<pre>
source /app/rv32sim/site-config.sh
$(RISCV_PREFIX)-objdump -d elfbinary
</pre>

In this case the "source" command is only needed once per login, as all that it does it set some environment variables.
The "elfbinary" should be replaced with a RISC-V rv32 binary.  Any of the homeworks on writing assembly have suitable 
Makefiles that show you how to generate one.  You can also just use a homework.

<h3>Structure</h3>
You are <i>strongly</i> encouraged to create verilog types for various fields (e.g. "regname", "funct7", etc).
You are also <i>strongly</i> encouraged to create functions to parse each of these pieces.
