Lab 1: Due Jan 28th, Support for ALU instructions
</title>
<body>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this lab you are to start building a multicycle RISC-V rv32i core.  The focus is on correctly
implementing ALU instructions (ADD, ADDI, SUB, SLL, SLLI, SRA, etc).  In this lab you do not have
to support branch and memory (load/store) instructions.  Your processor will be "multicycle", meaning
it will take multiple cycles to execute a single instruction.  These cycles are "fetch", "decode",
"execute", "memory" and "writeback".  See lab2.sv for more details.
</p>
<p>
A significant amount of infrastructure is provided in this lab that is not needed until lab3 and 4.
This is because it is best if you become familiar with the mechanics of getting assembly into your
processor and rather than learn something not useful it's easier (I believe) to just use the real
stuff to begin with.  To that end you are going to see instructions in the binary that will not
execute in lab 2.  That is OK.  What you need to do is edit "start.s" to add instructions to test
your work.
</p>
<p>
Finally note that memory modules are provided to you.  We will discuss memory in class and while
it is important that you learn how to code memories correctly in Verilog it's easier for now if
we just provide them to you.  In the next lab you will be using the data memory and there is
significant subtle behavior to understand there.
</p>
<p>
So how to get started?  My recommendation is you start by only doing the 3 register format instructions
(e.g. ADD, SUB, etc).  These are the R-format instructions.  You will need to write the code for
a register file.  Hopefully much of your lab1 decoding support can be re-used to decode these instructions
for you.  During the decode stage I recommend invoking your lab1 solution so you can see how the
processor progresses.  After you finish the R-format instructions I would move to the instructions
that take constants.  Remember that you need to check your work by editing start.s and inserting
instructions that you want to execute, and then invoking the build process again to have them
be compiled.

<h3>Structure</h3>
You are <i>strongly</i> encouraged to create verilog types for various fields (e.g. "regname", "funct7", etc).
You are also <i>strongly</i> encouraged to create functions to parse each of these pieces.  You
can see that I (routinely) violate the Verilog coding guide of only 1 always_comb and one clocked 
always block in a module.  This works because I only <i>write to a logic element</i> in single
always block.  I am also careful about cross-always block dependencies if they exist in always_comb
blocks.  You can follow this same structure if you like, or you can create modules for each stage of the
processor -- your choice.  Personally I find the module approach just as error prone as the all in one
module approach and more difficult to edit/debug.  But you do you...

<p>Other notes</p>
<ul>
<li>memory_io.sv contains the structures for communicating with memory.  Within them is a field
"user_tag".  You can ignore this.  It's part of my own work.  The other fields in the structures
are fairly self explanatory.  See memory.sv for further usage details.
