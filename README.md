## WIP
This is my pipelined, 5 cycle, 32 bit RISCV CPU. The Lab5 directory contains the latest version of my work. Within the Lab5 directories the files lab1.sv and lab5.sv are my own work, all other contents are supporting files used to test the CPU. These supporting files were not written by me and were written by [Professor Mark Oskin](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~oskin/) and the Winter 2025 EE469 teaching team at UW.
